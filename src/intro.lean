# The CAP Game, version 1.0.0.

Learn to use computers to formalize proofs!

# What is this game?

In this game, you will learn the basics of how a program called a *proof assistant* works and use it to formalize some
mathematical results.
On the left of the screen you will find *theorems* and *tactics* you can use to prove results.
Using this very precise language we can work on proofs like normal, using definitions and already established facts to show new results.
The proof assistant will keep track of what we know precisely, and show us what else needs to be shown to finish the current proof.

This is a very literal sort of computer assisted proof, using a computer to step through and
understand individual steps in a proof.
Later we will see how the assistant can do more than just follow our instructions, it can find
useful facts we might want to use for us, and even complete some moderately difficult proofs
on its own, based on pre-defined rules.

Have fun!
